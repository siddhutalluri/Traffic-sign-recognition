# Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## Overview

There might be many traffic sign recognition projects done before but my project works in real time. There are known Techniques like using OCR for sign detection and also CV techniques for colour and shape Detection (HIstogram Maching and SIFT/SURF) but they take time to process and they fail in realtime.

This repository contains the code for a Traffic Sign Recognition project. The project aims to recognize traffic signs from images using a machine learning model. The system can identify 43 different classes of traffic signs.It is done using tensorflow and GUI using TICKNER.The model was trained on the GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) dataset.
The dataset contains 43 different classes of traffic signs with a total of 50,000 images.
